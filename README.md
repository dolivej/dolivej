I'm a third-year Systems Design Engineering student from the University of Waterloo, Canada. I have completed 4 internships so far in the area of Product Management and Full-Stack Development at large companies like IBM and BlackBerry as well as startups.

I have an interest in all things design and development and love creating new features and products that drive impact and KPI's.
